						<strong>The version of GNU which is widely used today is more often known as "Linux" and many users are not aware of the extent of its connection with the GNU Project.</strong><br /><br />
						<p>Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in a combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU, with Linux functioning as its kernel.</p><br />

			<b>IRC (Internet Relay Chat)</b> is an Internet protocol for group communication.
			<br />
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat" target="_blank">&#187;&#187;Read about IRC on Wikipedia</a>
			<br />
 Each group(chat room) in IRC is identified by a channel name. You can join an IRC channel by entering your nick (like an username) and channel name(like #glugnith). Channel names always start with a # or ##. e.g. #glugnith, #fedora, #ubuntu, #c++ etc. 
			<br />
			<b>#glugnith</b> is the official IRC channel of GLUG NITH. You can join this channel and be the part of the discussion. You can also ask any GNU/Linux related problems here. We almost always hang out here, so this is the fastest way to reach us.
			<br />
			Since IRC is blocked by our college proxy, so you cannot use an IM client like Pidgin to connect to an IRC server from NITH. But you can use freenode's webchat interface to connect to IRC.

                    One of the big new features in Fedora 18 is that it now supports UEFI Secure Boot by using bootloaders that have been signed with Microsoft certificates. In short, you should have no trouble booting Fedora 18 with a Windows 8 PC.
