					<h3>What is Texinfo?</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="content_style1_info">
					<p>Texinfo is a documentation system that uses a single source file to produce both online information and printed output. This means that instead of writing different documents for online information and another for a printed manual, you need write only one document so that when the work is revised, you need revise only that one document. Texinfo supports a number of output formats, both online and printed, such as DVI, HTML, INFO, PDF, XML, etc.. The Texinfo system is well-integrated with GNU Emacs</p><br />

						 The <a href="http://glug.nith.ac.in/LDP">Linux Documentation Project (LDP)</a> is an all-volunteer project that maintains a large collection of GNU and Linux-related documentation and publishes the collection online. It began as a way for hackers to share their documentation with each other and with their users, and for users to share documentation with each other. Its documents tend to be oriented towards experienced users such as professional system administrators, but it also contains tutorials for beginners.<br /><a href="http://glug.nith.ac.in/LDP"> &#187;&#187;Visit LDP HOME.</a><br />
